**NOTE**: This is currently not usable.  Don't bother.

A decntralized Web browser extension.

## Ethereum

### Injection

This extension follows [EIP 1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193).

## Development

Perhaps this will have better docs later.

### Notes

In one terminal, run webpack:

    ./node_modules/.bin/webpack --color w

In another:

    web-ext run -v

This will launch Firefox with the temporary extension installed, and reload on
file changes.
